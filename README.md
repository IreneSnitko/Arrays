> `ArraysAlgorithms`--------------------> various algorithms for actions with array elements

###### Methods in this Class accept an array and return: ######

       - the array of odd index values
       
       - the sum of all the array numbers
       
       - the array, containing minimum & maximum & average values between these indices
       
       - the array with the values of peak elements
       
       - the array of common elements
       
       - the "reverse" array
       
       - sorted array with elements in ascending order
       
       - the array in which all negative numbers are in the second half of the array 

> `MethodsForArraysActions`------------> creation the different methods for array actions
    
###### Methods in this Class: ######
   
       - create an array with the selected parameters of different data types
    
       - identificate of the quantity odd or even numbers in an array
    
       - create new arrays of odd or even numbers from the original array

       - count the sum of numbers of the second half of the array
       
       - create a new array with the results of multiplication by a given number
       
       - create a new array of differences between tens and ones of numbers of the original array       

> `MultiDimensionalArrays`-------------> creation 2D-arrays and simple actions with them

> `OneDimensionalArraysCreation`-------> creation one-dimensional arrays and simple actions with them

> `RealizationArraysAlgorithms`--------> running the code in the console
