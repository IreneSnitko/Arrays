> `ArraysAlgorithms`-----> various algorithms for actions with array elements | Methods in this Class accept an array and return:

                         - the array of odd index values
       
                         - the sum of all the array numbers
       
                         - the array, containing minimum & maximum & average values between these indices
       
                         - the array with the values of peak elements
       
                         - the array of common elements
       
                         - the "reverse" array
       
                         - sorted array with elements in ascending order
       
                         - the array in which all negative numbers are in the second half of the array 

> `MethodsForArraysActions`-----> creation the different methods for array actions | Methods in this Class:   
   
                         - create an array with the selected parameters of different data types
    
                         - identificate of the quantity odd or even numbers in an array
    
                         - create new arrays of odd or even numbers from the original array

                         - count the sum of numbers of the second half of the array
       
                         - create a new array with the results of multiplication by a given number
       
                         - create a new array of differences between tens and ones of numbers of the original array       

> `MultiDimensionalArrays`----------> creation 2D-arrays and simple actions with them

> `OneDimensionalArraysCreation`----> creation one-dimensional arrays and simple actions with them
