> `ArraysAlgorithms`-----> various algorithms for actions with array elements | Methods in this Class accept an array and return:

              - the array of odd index values
       
              - the sum of all the array numbers
       
              - the array, containing minimum & maximum & average values between these indices
       
              - the array with the values of peak elements
       
              - the array of common elements
       
              - the "reverse" array
       
              - sorted array with elements in ascending order
       
              - the array in which all negative numbers are in the second half of the array

> `MethodsForArraysActions`-----> creation the different methods for array actions | Methods in this Class return:   
   
              - an array with the selected parameters of different data types
    
              - quantity odd or even numbers in an array
    
              - new arrays of odd or even numbers from the original array

              - the sum of numbers of the second half of the array
       
              - a new array with the results of multiplication by a given number
       
              - a new array of differences between tens and ones of numbers of the original array
