> `ArraysAlgorithms`-------------------->various algorithms for actions with array elements

###### Methods in this Class accept an array and return: ######

       > the array of odd index values
       
       > the sum of all the array numbers
       
       > the array, containing minimum & maximum & average values between these indices
       
       > the array with the values of peak elements
       
       > the array of common elements
       
       > the "reverse" array
       
       > sorted array with elements in ascending order
       
       > the array in which all negative numbers are in the second half of the array

> `MethodsForArraysActions`------------>creation the different methods for array actions
    
###### Methods in this Class: ######
   
       > creation an array with the selected parameters of different data types
    
       > identification of the quantity odd or even numbers in an array
    
       > creation new arrays of odd or even numbers from the original array

       > counting the sum of numbers of the second half of the array
       
       > creation a new array with the results of multiplication by a given number
       
       > creation a new array of differences between tens and ones of numbers of the original array

> `OneDimensionalArraysCreation`------->creation one-dimensional arrays and simple actions with them

> `MultiDimensionalArrays`------------->creation 2D-arrays and simple actions with them
