> `ArraysAlgorithms`-------------------->various algorithms for actions with array elements

###### Methods in this Class accept an array and return: ######

       ######## the array of odd index values
       
       the sum of all the array numbers
       
       the array, containing minimum & maximum & average values between these indices
       
       the array with the values of peak elements
       
       the array of common elements
       
       the "reverse" array
       
       sorted array with elements in ascending order
       
       the array in which all negative numbers are in the second half of the array ########

> `MethodsForArraysActions`------------>creation the different methods for array actions
    
###### Methods in this Class: ######
   
       > creation an array with the selected parameters of different data types
    
       > identification of the quantity odd or even numbers in an array
    
       > creation new arrays of odd or even numbers from the original array

       > counting the sum of numbers of the second half of the array
       
       > creation a new array with the results of multiplication by a given number
       
       > creation a new array of differences between tens and ones of numbers of the original array

> `OneDimensionalArraysCreation`------->creation one-dimensional arrays and simple actions with them

> `MultiDimensionalArrays`------------->creation 2D-arrays and simple actions with them
